Nossa miss\u00e3o \u00e9 \u201ccreate more owners\u201d (criar mais propriet\u00e1rios). N\u00f3s ajudamos pessoas a terem participa\u00e7\u00e3o na riqueza criada por empresas de capital fechado \u2014 as quais ainda n\u00e3o participam de transa\u00e7\u00f5es na bolsa de valores. Essa riqueza \u00e9 representada por \u201cequity\u201d ou cotas de participa\u00e7\u00e3o nessas empresas. Fundadores de empresas de capital fechado oferecem equity a investidores em troca de investimentos que ser\u00e3o usados para o crescimento da empresa. Frequentemente, eles tamb\u00e9m oferecem equity para seus funcion\u00e1rios como parte de seu plano de benef\u00edcios, al\u00e9m dos sal\u00e1rios.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;A Carta torna o gerenciamento de equity mais f\u00e1cil para fundadores, investidores e funcion\u00e1rios.

Simplificar o gerenciamento de cap tables \u00e9 um grande problema nos Estados Unidos, onde empresas de capital fechado t\u00eam centenas ou milhares de investidores. Este n\u00e3o \u00e9 um problema que chegou ao Brasil: grande parte das empresas de capital fechado no Brasil ainda n\u00e3o oferece equity aos seus funcion\u00e1rios como parte da remunera\u00e7\u00e3o \u2014 mas essa \u00e9 uma realidade que esperamos mudar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Na Carta, somos prestativos, transparentes, justos e am\u00e1veis.
