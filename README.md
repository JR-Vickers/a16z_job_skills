# INTRO

This is a small project in which I scraped data from the careers' page of [35 a16z-backed startups](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordanmazer_these-35-andreessen-horowitz-backed-companies-activity-7320077608052764672-A2Kg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACxXoykB8aL2eDtVoQzAVrRBauNOqQkoC4w) to determine which are some of the most in-demand skills at startups right now.

## Getting Started
From your terminal, run

```
jupyter notebook
```

and you'll be up and running in no time.
